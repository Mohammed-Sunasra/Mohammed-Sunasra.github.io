Hello there! I am Mohammed, welcome to my blog. I am an engineer that likes to work on challenging problems

## What I do currently

Currently, I am working as a Co-founder at [Pixeldust Technologies](https://www.pixeldust.in/) where I look into multiple areas in tech spanning from Backend engineering to Machine/Deep Learning to DevOps.

## About Pixeldust

We work with all sizes of companies either Fortune 500 or early-stage startups to help them build their tech platforms and products with modern, robust, and state-of-the-art tools and technologies.

We help our clients with plug-and-play teams right from Day1 so we can get help them get started and they can focus on their business growth rather than worrying about technological capabilities and challenges

## Why this blog?

I believe teaching is the best way of learning and diving deeper into concepts.
This blog serves as a notes app or living documentation about stuff I am learning/experiencing over time, so you could find me revisiting the content and updating it as needed.
<br>
I hope people find the content interesting and helpful in their tech journey.
Another reason is I also wanted to improve my writing skills and couldn't have found a better way of doing so without this blog, so here we are!
