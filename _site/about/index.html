<h2 id="why-this-blog">Why this blog?</h2>

<p>I believe teaching is the best way of learning and diving deeper into concepts.
This blog serves as a notes app or living documentation about stuff I am learning/experiencing over time, so you could find me revisiting the content and updating it as needed.
<br />
I hope people find the content interesting and helpful in their tech journey.
Another reason is I also wanted to improve my writing skills and couldnâ€™t have found a better way of doing so without this blog, so here we are!</p>
