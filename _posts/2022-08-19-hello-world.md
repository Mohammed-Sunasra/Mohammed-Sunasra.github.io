## Overview

Hello there! Welcome to my blog. I am a tech enthusiast currently building Pixeldust and working as an all-around engineer in the areas of Backend Development, MLOPs, Machine learning, and also a bit on DevOps. If you wish to find more about me or contact me, please visit [About]({% link about.md %}) or [Contact]({% link contact.md %})

While I have always pondered upon the idea of starting a tech blog for the past few years, I found myself too busy either building stuff or learning new skills.

I am currently at a stage where I get to try out a lot of new stuff in tech(languages, tools, frameworks) and always wanted to document my understanding.

## Topics

You would find me posting about things like Programming(in general), Django, REST APIs, Docker, Kubernetes, Podcasts, or life experiences.

Many of the posts in this blog would be like notes, so I'll revisit them, add more content or change something here and there.

The main purpose of this blog is to keep things as a living document that I can use to teach others and also re-learn things in the future to refresh my memory.

Excited to start doing what I always wanted and would try my best to explain things in a way people can benefit from it.

<strong>Thank you,</strong>
:heart:
